# Simple notes app
Built by myself as a means to try out tsoa  
Much of a work-in-progress
___


### TODO

new routes:  
DELETE note  
PATCH note -- update a note in place (or can use PUT here, undecided)  

Unit tests

Some sort of free text search query, over note titles  
Same as above but over note body content  
Same as above but for both?  

Longer term:  
serverless in some way using aws technologies, design still needed  
Integrate support for a voice-triggered client, probably need a separate client-side project for this
