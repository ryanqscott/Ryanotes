# Simple notes app

Built by myself as a means to try out tsoa  
Much of a work-in-progress

---

### TODO

new routes:  
DELETE note  
PATCH note -- update a note in place (or can use PUT here, undecided)

Maybe some form of integration testing using e.g. [newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman#using-newman-as-a-library)  
Unit tests  
create data folder if it doesn't exist on startup

Some sort of free text search query, over note titles  
Same as above but over note body content  
Same as above but for both?

Longer term:  
serverless in some way using aws technologies, design still needed  
Integrate support for a voice-triggered client, probably need a separate client-side project for this
